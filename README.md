# PHP Workshop ClassicModels

## What is this ?
With this template repository I'm building a simple application in PHP containing the following features :

    - Display a list of products
    - Display a single product
    - Register a new user
    - Login a user
    - Logout a user

## Requirements
Docker Engine and Docker Compose

## Notes
The Docker Compose file was _initially_ generated by [phpdocker.io](https://phpdocker.io/).
